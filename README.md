# Personal Website

This website was developed as a final assignment on the web-technologies course. This course started at a good time because I already had planned to make myself a personal website. So now I had time to focus on it and do it with care. I made everything myself from the beginning. I didnâ€™t use bootstrap or any ready-made elements to make this site.
